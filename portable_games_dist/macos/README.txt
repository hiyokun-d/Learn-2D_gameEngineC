=================================================
       2D Game Collection for macOS
=================================================

This package contains two SDL2-based games as macOS applications:

1. Breakout.app - A classic brick-breaking game
2. SnakeGame.app - Control a snake to eat food and grow

RUNNING THE GAMES:
----------------
Simply double-click on the .app bundles to run the games.

If you get a security warning:
1. Right-click (or Control+click) on the .app file
2. Select "Open" from the context menu
3. Click "Open" in the dialog that appears

The games should have SDL2 frameworks embedded, so they should
run without requiring SDL2 to be installed on the target system.

CONTROLS:
--------
- Breakout: A/D keys to move the paddle
- Snake: Arrow keys or WASD to change direction
